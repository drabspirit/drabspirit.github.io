Instead of setting up clients, VPNs, and automation, TorBox does it all for you. With a premium UI, extreme speed, and supportive community, there is no better service. All you have to do is add torrents, and download them when they're done. With many integrations and more coming soon, TorBox is the best way to download torrents, from anywhere, on any device."},{question:"Is the free plan really free?",answer:"Yes! The free plan is completely free, and will always be free. We do not require any payment information to sign up for the free plan, and you can use it for as long as you want. The free plan has some restrictions that you can upgrade to bypass, but it is completely free. It is very usable and has almost all the features of the paid plans. This is our contribution to the future of torrenting and peer to peer technologies, making it more accessible, open and usable."},{question:"Is TorBox secure and safe?",answer:"TorBox is 100% safe. We don't track IP or tie downloads to a user, and we don't use a user's internet connection to download the torrents themselves. The only connection that you will have is to our own servers, which don't store any information about you. Your ISP will never be able to figure it out. All downloads are encrypted over SSL with HTTPS and follow the latest security standards. Don't believe us? Check out our Discord server, and ask around."},{question:"Can I use TorBox to download torrents anonymously?",answer:"Yes! TorBox is the perfect way to download torrents anonymously. We don't track IP, or tie downloads to a user. If you download a torrent, no one will know it was you. To get even better security, if you delete a torrent, everything is deleted, and there is no way to recover it. We only store the fact that you downloaded a torrent, no hashes, no magnets, no files, no IP addresses, nothing. You can also request to have your account deleted, and we will delete everything, and there will be no way to recover it."},{question:"Can I use TorBox to download torrents on my phone?",answer:"Yes! TorBox is a web app, so you can use it on any device that has a web browser. There is also a mobile app available to download for Android, and soon iOS. You may also use our WebDAV which is compatible with any device and allows you to download and view your downloads."},{question:"Are torrents cached?",answer:"Popular torrents are cached, and will instantly be available for you to download. If a torrent is not cached yet, as soon as you download it, it will be cached and be available for you and anyone else to download instantly."},{question:"What is the difference between TorBox and a seed box?",answer:"A seed box is a server that you rent, and have to setup to download torrents. It does come with many perks such as being able to set up *Arr apps, other automation apps and even media servers to watch your content you download. However, it is very expensive, and you have to set it up yourself. TorBox is a pre-configured seed box, with better pricing, and better speeds than conventional seed boxes."}],l=e=>{let{question:o,answer:t,isOpen:a,onClick:i}=e;return(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"bg-[#0d0f13] rounded-lg border border-[#04bf8a]/10 transition-all duration-300 card-hover-glow overflow-hidden",children:[(0,n.jsxs)("button",{className:"w-full px-6 py-4 flex justify-between items-center text-left hover:bg-[#0d0f13]/80 transition-colors",onClick:i,children:[(0,n.jsx)("h3",{className:"text-xl font-share-tech",children:o}),(0,n.jsx)(r.Z,{className:(0,s.cn)("w-5 h-5 text-[#04bf8a] transition-transform duration-300",a?"rotate-180":"")})]}),(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:(0,s.cn)("grid transition-all duration-300",a?"grid-rows-[1fr]":"grid-rows-[0fr]"),children:(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"overflow-hidden",children:(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"px-6 pb-4",children:(0,n.jsx)("p",{className:"text-gray-400 leading-relaxed",children:t})})})})]})};function d(){let[e,o]=(0,a.useState)(null);return(0,n.jsx)("section",{id:"faq",className:"relative py-24",children:(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"relative max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8",children:[(0,n.jsx)("h2",{className:"text-3xl font-share-tech text-center mb-12 glow-effect",children:"Frequently Asked Questions"}),(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"space-y-4",children:i.map((t,a)=>(0,n.jsx)(l,{question:t.question,answer:t.answer,isOpen:e===a,onClick:()=>o(e===a?null:a)},a))})]})})}},2169:function(e,o,t){"use strict";t.d(o,{cn:function(){return r}});var n=t(3167),a=t(1367);function r(){for(var e=arguments.length,o=Array(e),t=0;t<e;t++)o[t]=arguments[t];return(0,a.m6)((0,n.W)(o))}}},function(e){e.O(0,[52,971,69,744],function(){return e(e.s=9285)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
